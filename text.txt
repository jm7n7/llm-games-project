so now you have the git repo on your machine locally. if you look in the bottom left, you can see which branch you are on

so, we can each have our own branch.
when we save our code, it saves to the specific branch. We never want to save to main unless we are absolutely sure we want to push those updates.

So, you work in your branch and it doesnt have to worry about overwritting each others code.

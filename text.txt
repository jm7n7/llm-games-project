so now you have the git repo on your machine locally. if you look in the bottom left, you can see which branch you are on

so, we can each have our own branch.
when we save our code, it saves to the specific branch. We never want to save to main unless we are absolutely sure we want to push those updates.

So, you work in your branch and it doesnt have to worry about overwritting each others code.


only when you want to send your code to github

you dont need to worry about doing the compare and pull request. That is when you want to merge your code to the main branch.

#import your repo
git clone <paste link from github>

#set your github username
git config user.name "your user name here"

#set your github user email
git config user.email "youremail@thing.com"
